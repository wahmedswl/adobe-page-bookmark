##### Shortcuts

* Bookmark Page
```
Alt+V then +
```

* Goto last Bookmarked Page
```
Alt+V then -
```

* Clear Bookmarked Pages
```
Alt+V then *
```

##### Live Bookmarking
```
Although, individual pages can be bookmarked using Menu Item (Bookmark) or with Shortcut but it's cumbersome when you constantly navigating back and forth and here comes, Live Bookmark. It will continuously bookmark pages as you move from page to page and you can easy move to bookmarked pages with shortcut or Menu Item (Last Bookmark). It's correct mostly and helpful always but it's little cheesy right now.
